# Casting Agency app

The app is currently deployed on Heroku, you can access it at https://castag-herokuapp.herokuapp.com/.

## Authorization

You need a valid token to access the app's API (except for the one public endpoint), for one of the two existing roles: **casting director**, or **casting agent**. The director has access to all the endpoints, and the agent can only retrieve information about actors.
Valid tokens for each of these roles are currently included in the `setup.sh` file for the project validation. They are to be exported as environment variables when the app is tested locally.

## Local installation and use

In order to test or run the app locally, first set up a Python virtual environment with the library of your choice, then install dependencies with:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then create one database for running the app and one for testing:
```bash
createdb casting_agency
createdb casting_agency_test
```

Then set environment variables with `setup.sh`:
```bash
source setup.sh
```
This script defines environment variables for the application configuration, auth0 configuration, and - temporarily - tokens that are used in the testing script.
**NB**: the default local setting is a testing environment. Production and Development settings are associated with deployment on Heroku. This can be modified in the `config.py` file as needed.

The app can then be run with the following command:
```bash
FLASK_APP=app.py flask run
```

### Tests
Tests can be run with the following command:
```bash
pytest test_app.py
```
